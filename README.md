# PREWORK STUDY GUIDE 

## Description
This study guide was created as a tool for users to reflect back on and go over the information that they will have learned during the prework for the UW Coding Bootcamp. It will cover all of the topics that were covered (HTML, GIT, CSS, and Java Script), and it also has a feature to help you decide which topic to study! 


## Installation

This study guide requires no installation! 

(However if you'd like to use the feature that helps you decide what to study, you will need to make sure you have Google Chrome web browser installed on your system so that you can use the Chrome DevTools functionality.) 

## Usage

Using this study guide is easy! Scroll through and review the notes in each section. 

If you would like to use the study topic suggestions feature, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing command+option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open. The console panel that is opened shows you the list of topics to go over from the Prework, as well as a suggestion on which topic to study first! 
To have a new study topic suggested in the console panel, just refresh the webpage.
